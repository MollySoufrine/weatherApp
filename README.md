# weatherApp

for this app we wanted to show a five day forecast for any city searched that showed a uv index as well.

This app would give you each date for the next five days, uv index, a little icon with how the weather was, sunny or clouds. It would also tell you the temperature for the next five days.

I began by creating a list and having the days append in a for loop with the emp and humidity.

However the more I spoke to some peers and did some research i saw people used cards and rows and columns instead so I then started to change how i had it formatted.

I would like to submit this now so I can atleast have something submitted but will contiue working on this.
